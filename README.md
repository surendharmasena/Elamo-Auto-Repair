# Elamo-Auto-Repair
A creation of a relational database for an automobile repair company. Each file corresponds to a different phase of the SDLC. First, a logical schema was created based on information from the company regarding its business rules. Eventually, this transformed into a physical schema to remove any functional dependencies prior to database implementation in SQL. The third file is a data dictionary to illustrate primary and foreign keys. Finally, the fourth file shows the query that successfully designs the database based on the company's objects.
